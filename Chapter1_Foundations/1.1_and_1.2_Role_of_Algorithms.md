## Section 1.1
```
**Definitions**
- Algorithm: it is a series of computational steps that transforms input into output. It basically takes some value as
input and then returns some value as output.

- Data Structure: a way to store and organize data to facilitate access and modifications. 
```

<br>

An algorithm is best for a given application based on a number of different factors. These factors are the input size, if 
it is already sorted to an extent, restrictions, type of device, memory, and space.

An algorithm is said to be **correct** if for every input, it halts with the right output. Basically, if we have 0 and we multiply it with anything, it will always return 0. And we know that's correct. On the other hand an incorrect algorithm will either give the wrong answer or not even halt at all.

## Section 1.2
Because computers are fast, but not infinitely fast, and computers dont have unlimited memory, we need to keep a close eye on our time and memory. Hence, the space complexity and time complexity. This brings up something that Jee Wei said, its the "No Free Lunch Theorem", if you are good in time, you pay in space. If you are good in space, you pay in time.

```
Efficiency
- Usually insertion sort is faster than merge sort. However, when the input size n becomes very large, merge sort
does become faster than insertion sort at some time. This is a prime example of efficiency, where we may choose one
sorting algorithm over another.
