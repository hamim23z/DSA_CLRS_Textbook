## Insertion Sort
- So this is the first and most common sorting algorithm. Insertion sort. It works by taking a sequence of numbers (call these n). And then the output should be a sorted version of them. Typically, we can either sort it in ascending or descending order. Or to be honest, any order that we want.
- Notations:
    - The numbers we want to sort are the keys.
    - The input is an array.
    - The output is an array too.

So how does insertion sort work. Say we have our left hand empty and then we have cards on the table. We then use our right hand to pick up cards from the table and place it into our left hand. While we are grabbing from the pile and putting it into our left hand, we are putting the cards in order. **The insertion sort algorithm sorts the input numbers in place**. 
- The way I interpret it is given our array, we clearly have indexes, index 0 and onwards. So we start with index 0. We keep it as is and basically skip over it to go to index 1. And whether we are sorting in ascending or descending order, we will either move index 1 before index 0 or keep it as is. And then we continue this process. We always use the left and right indexes.
